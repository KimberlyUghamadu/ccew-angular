Lesson 3: Twitter Bootstrap Exercises
====

#### Assignment 2: Bootstrap based website

Complete the files in the *bootstrap-lesson* directory:

1. index.html
2. about.html
3. signup.html
4. reports.html

For this assignment you will need to create the files from scratch. I've added an empty file for each page. You will generate all the HTML. 

You should base your HTML on the Bootstrap "Basic Template". In order to do this, you'll need to download the Bootstrap framework to your computer.

Don't forget the [HTML shim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Shiv) inlcuded with Bootstrap, and don't forget to edit the template to take into account the directory structure you're using.

Work together and refer to the Twitter Bootstrap documentation when you need help.

#### Navigation and Container

Each page should have a working Bootstrap-based navigation bar with links to all the other pages that also indicates the current page, as in the earlier *navbar* assignment. Each page should also have a container div that contains the rest of the page.

#### Index.html

The index is the front landing page for our site. Use the jumbotron component and featurette components to highlight the site. Make up marketing copy (text) for a data analysis firm. For images, use the *holder.js* file Bootstrap makes use of in its examples.

#### About.html

Create an about page that describes the business and the team. Add images for team members. The images should be circles, but don't edit square images. Use Bootstrap's support for making a rectangular image appear circular. Again, make up the copy (text contents).

#### Signup.html

Create a sign up page for the product. Create a form using Bootstrap's form classes. Your sign up form should require an email address and password. No username and no password confirmation field. Include a signup button.

#### Reports.html

The reports page is where your customers go to view the data reports available to them. Use Bootstrap's grid system to create a two column layout. The left column is the sidebar (width:4) that contains a [List Group](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#list-group) component. The right column is the main content area (width:8) and should include a sample report or chart. If you're feeling brave, try incorporating one of the examples from [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).
